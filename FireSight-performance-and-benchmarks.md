_FireSight_ performance benchmarks are done using the `-time` option of `firesight` command line executable. This option is only for still images and does not work for video. The implementation of this option executes the pipeline 100 times and prints out the average execution time. For some busybody operating systems such as Windows, take the lowest of several timings, since the operating system may be engaged in other activities such as checking your email, etc.
